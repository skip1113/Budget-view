## Overview
This is a React budgeting application for all users finding a way to save money or get advice, with the bonus of having a tip calculator 
when you're at a restaurant. Other features are being able to create your own plan saving money through the month, and see what you're spending over the years. Budgeting isn't so simple, but this app will be able to help out. First put the average income (doesn't need to be exact) then fill out the name and price of your spendings. This will be calculated in the total amount the user is spending, the total of what you spend versus what you accumulate and the grand total on a yearly basis. You may also create and save a plan if you wanted to save some money. This app is disgned for the user to see what they're spending with the amount they have and "help" the user start a saving plan. There are also a Tips & Advice tab for the users to study to be able to gain the knowledge to help them save some cash.
